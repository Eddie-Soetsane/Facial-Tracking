# Facial-Tracking

## Using Artificial Intelligence to detect human emotion and create AI images based on those emotions.

This project was my final year project dissertation for my computer science degree. In this repository
you will be able to see how I created each of the neural networks needed for the project. How I did my
evaluation and how I incorparated it into an application.

1. First will be my prototype neural network a small video of it working will be attached.
2. Next is me creating different types of neural networks for this project I used my own, RCnn and SSD MobileNet
3. Next is me exporting the neural networks
4. Creating an application using Python
5. Add in the conversion of emotion into words for prompts for the AI images
6. Combine everything together
