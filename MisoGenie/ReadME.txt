1. There is three sections in the miso.genie.ai. Real time detection, image detection and ai art creation
2. The real time detection is created from my custom cnn model 
3. The image time detection is created from my cusom cnn model
4. Ai art is created from Stable Diffusion, and uses the result of my custom model as a prompt
5. When running the AI art section it could run slowly or the app freezes this is normal
